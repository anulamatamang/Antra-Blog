                        <p>
                        When someone asks - what does Samsara mean ? The answer can be shortened to - all existences that are conditioned by:
                        ignorance, suffering and the inexplicable flow of time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Often painted on the exterior walls of Buddhist monasteries, The Wheel of Life can be considered the very essence of the
                        Buddhist philosophy as it offers insights into some of its most important concepts. It depicts and explains the cyclic
                        nature of re-incarnation and the different aspects of our perceived reality. It also shows the importance our actions
                        have on our existence - or what we like to call <span class="text-blue">Karma</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The notion of re-incarnation is also to be found in Vedic literature - <em>"bhavachakra"</em> in Sanskrit is a synonym of the
                        word Samsara. This can be divided into - <em>bhava</em> - which means origin or worldly existence and - <em>chakra</em> - which means
                        circle or rotation. This idea of a rotation or cycle, is in fact re-incarnation ! We do not occupy a stable place within
                        <em>Samsara</em>, but depending on our Karma we will pass from one existence to another.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Beyond the <em>Samsara</em> we have <em>Nirvana</em>, the world unaffected by negative emotions, which by definition is the true nature of
                            happiness and the ultimate realization that we are all seeking for. We are all Buddhas waiting to become enlightened.

                                The three poisons or the three fundamental sufferings (by this I mean the three things from which we suffer every hour
                                of every day until we reach nirvana) occupy the center of the Wheel of Life, as they act as “fuel” giving momentum to
                                the “wheel”.

                                The use of animals as imagery here is important, we can see that each animal is holding onto the tail of the animal
                                infront of him. Which symbolizes the fact that these negative emotions lead to each other in an endless loop. It is only
                                by our effort and spiritual progress that we are able to gradually gain control and ultimately destroy these emotions

                            <h2 class="text-dark">BARDO : BETWEEN DEATH AND RE-BIRTH..</h2>
                            <p>
                                The next circle out from the Wheel of Life is called Bardo and shows spirits pulled downwards by Demons (right), as they
                                have forgotten Dharma and let the 3 Poisons overcome them. And disciples of dharma being lead upwards, having fought to
                                overcome the 3 Poisons, and the negative <span class="text-blue">karma</span> that it brings.The term Bardo has no direct translation, as it roots
                                itself in the concept of re-birth, something I consider to be relatively new to the “west”. It represents the state
                                which our spirits find themselves in the moment between life and death – the Intermediate State.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Samsara begins at the subconscious state of Bardo, continues into birth and is completed at the moment of death, thus
                                the imagery or literal translation : the Wheel of Life.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As our Karma matures, it will find itself in its corresponding “world”.
                                If individuals find themselves with similar Karmas, their conscious will experience, through common perceptions, an
                                identical world. Humans for example, all have identical sense organs (the 5 senses) which grant them access to an
                                identical world (ours). Buddhism however allows a multiplicity of possible manifestations, each functioning in a
                                parallel “universe”.
